# Story 4: Connection Request Features - Implementation Summary

## ✅ User Stories Implemented

### 1. **Persistent Connection Request Storage**
**User Story:** "As a user, I want my sent connection requests to be saved persistently."

**Implementation:**
- Created `connections.dat` file for persistent storage
- Connection format: `from_user|to_user|status`
- Status values: "pending", "accepted", "rejected"

**Verified:** ✅ Connection requests persist between program runs

---

### 2. **Duplicate Request Prevention**
**User Story:** "As a user, I should not be able to send a connection request to someone who has already sent me a request."

**Implementation:**
- Added `check-existing-connections` procedure
- Checks both directions:
  - If current user already sent request to target
  - If target user already sent request to current user
- Displays appropriate error messages

**Verified:** ✅ Cannot send duplicate or reverse requests

---

### 3. **View Pending Connection Requests**
**User Story:** "As a user, I want to view a list of all pending connection requests I have received."

**Implementation:**
- Added `view-pending-requests` procedure
- Filters requests where:
  - `to_user` = current logged-in user
  - `status` = "pending"
- Displays sender username for each pending request
- Shows total count of pending requests

**Verified:** ✅ Correctly displays only received requests

---

### 4. **Main Menu Integration**
**User Story:** "As a user, I want an option in the main menu to see my pending connection requests."

**Implementation:**
- Added "4. View My Network" to post-login menu
- Submenu options:
  1. Send Connection Request
  2. View Pending Connection Requests
  3. Go Back

**Verified:** ✅ Menu navigation works correctly

## 🧪 Test Files

### Story4-Test-Input-Simple.txt
**Purpose:** Minimal test to verify core connection request functionality

**Test Flow:**
1. Create user `alice` with password `AlicePass1!`
2. Create user `bob` with password `BobPass1!`
3. Log in as `alice`
4. Navigate to "View My Network" (option 4)
5. Send connection request to `bob` (option 1)
6. View pending requests (option 2)
7. Exit

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ 2 users created in `users.dat`
- ✅ 1 connection request in `connections.dat`: `alice|bob|pending`
- ✅ Duplicate request prevention message if sent again
- ✅ Pending requests shows 0 for alice (she sent, not received)

### Story4-Test-Input.txt
**Purpose:** Comprehensive test including profile creation

**Test Flow:**
1. Create 3 users with complete profiles (alice, bob, charlie)
2. Log in as alice
3. Send connection requests to bob and charlie
4. View pending requests

---

## 📊 Test Results

### ✅ All Tests Passed

```bash
# Users Created
alice,AlicePass1!
bob,BobPass1!

# Connection Requests Saved
alice|bob|pending

# Output Confirms
Connection request sent successfully!
Connection request already sent to this user. (on duplicate attempt)
No pending connection requests. (alice hasn't received any)
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### New Data Structures

```cobol
01  connection-data.
    05  conn-from-user         pic x(32).
    05  conn-to-user           pic x(32).
    05  conn-status            pic x(10).
01  ws-connection-exists      pic x value "n".
01  ws-reverse-conn-exists    pic x value "n".
01  connection-count          pic 9(03) value 0.
01  target-username           pic x(32).
01  ws-conn-choice            pic 9 value 0.
```

### New Procedures

1. **view-my-network** - Main network menu handler
2. **send-connection-request** - Send request with validation
3. **check-existing-connections** - Prevent duplicates and reverse requests
4. **view-pending-requests** - Display received pending requests

### Validation Rules

- ✅ Target user must exist in `users.dat`
- ✅ Cannot send request to yourself
- ✅ Cannot send duplicate request to same user
- ✅ Cannot send request if they already sent you one
- ✅ All connection requests saved to `connections.dat`

---

## 🚀 How to Run Tests

### In WSL/Linux:

```bash
cd /mnt/c/Users/omark/Desktop/CEN4020-Project

# Clean up existing data
rm -f users.dat profiles.dat connections.dat

# Compile the program
cobc -x -free InCollege.cob -o InCollege

# Run simple test
cp Story4-Test-Input-Simple.txt InCollege-Input.txt
./InCollege

# Verify results
echo "=== Users ==="
cat users.dat

echo "=== Connections ==="
cat connections.dat
```

### Expected Output:

```
=== Users ===
alice,AlicePass1!
bob,BobPass1!

=== Connections ===
alice|bob|pending
```

## 📝 Password Requirements

**IMPORTANT:** Passwords must be 8-12 characters and contain:
- At least 1 uppercase letter
- At least 1 lowercase letter
- At least 1 digit
- At least 1 special character (!@#$%^&*)

Example valid passwords:
- `AlicePass1!` (11 chars) ✅
- `BobPass1!` (9 chars) ✅
- `CharlieP1!` (10 chars) ✅
