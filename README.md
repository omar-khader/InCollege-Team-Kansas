# InCollege â€” GNU COBOL Project

A simple COBOL program that supports **account creation**, **login**, and a post-login menu with **Create/Edit Profile**, **View Profile**, **Search for User**, **Learn a New Skill**, **View My Pending Connection Requests**, and **View My Network**. The app is file-driven (reads from an input file and mirrors all output to a file). Post-login menu options, connection management, and profile prompts are confirmed by the current output transcript.

Runs in **Docker + VS Code Dev Containers** (cross-platform: Windows/macOS/Linux).

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

* **Docker Desktop** (install)
* **VS Code** (install)
* VS Code **Dev Containers** extension (`ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers`)

### Build & Run

1. Clone this repo and open it in VS Code.
2. **Reopen in container** when prompted.
3. Build & run:

   ```bash
   cobc -x -free InCollege.cob -o InCollege
   ./InCollege
   ```

> The program reads from `InCollege-Input.txt` and mirrors all console output to `InCollege-Output.txt`. A successful login looks like:
>
> ```
> You have successfully logged in.
> Welcome, TestUser!
> ```
>

## Files & I/O

* **Runtime input:** `InCollege-Input.txt`
  Plain text, **one token per line** (menu choice, username, password, profile fields, accept/reject decisions, etc.). See the current example input below.
* **Runtime output:** `InCollege-Output.txt`
  Mirrors all on-screen messages and menus (including the post-login menu, connection management prompts, and network display).
* **Persistent users:** `users.dat` (format: `username,password`)
* **Persistent connections:** `connections.dat` (format: `requester_username|target_username|status`) -- used to store pending connection requests and accepted connections. Status values: `pending` for requests awaiting action, `accepted` for established connections.
* **Optional batch tests:** `InCollege-Test.txt`

## Features (currently implemented)

After a successful login, the main menu offers:

1. **Create/Edit My Profile**
2. **View My Profile**
3. **Search for User**
4. **Learn a New Skill**
5. **View My Pending Connection Requests**
6. **View My Network**

The menu and prompts are visible in the current output transcript.

### Connection Management (Epic #5):

- **Sending connection requests:** From the search result view you can send a connection request to the displayed user. The program will validate and persist requests (no duplicate requests, and you cannot send a request to yourself).
- **Managing pending requests:** Use the "View My Pending Connection Requests" menu item to list requests you've received. For each pending request, you can choose to accept or reject it.
  - **Accepting:** Establishes a permanent connection between both users and removes the request from pending status.
  - **Rejecting:** Removes the request from pending status without establishing a connection.
- **Viewing your network:** Use the "View My Network" menu item to see a list of all users you are connected with, including their name, university, and major.
- **Persistence:** All connection requests (pending and accepted) persist between program runs via `connections.dat`.
- Example output messages include: "Connection request sent to <n>.", "Connection request from <n> accepted!", "Connection request from <n> rejected.", and "You have no pending connection requests at this time."

## Input Format

> **Important:** The program consumes inputs line-by-line from `InCollege-Input.txt`. Keep exactly one value per line.

### Create Account

```
2
username
Password1!
```

### Log In

```
1
username
Password1!
```

### Create/Edit Profile (sample sequence)

Below is a minimal example of profile data (after logging in, choose `1` for Create/Edit Profile, then provide fields; use `DONE` to finish optional lists):

```
John
Doe
Example University
Computer Science
2025
Enthusiastic developer always learning new things.
Software Intern
Tech Corp
Summer 2024
Developed tools for internal testing.
DONE
Bachelor of Science
Example University
2021-2025
DONE
```

This ordering matches the current profile prompts shown by the program.

### Accept/Reject Connection Requests

When viewing pending connection requests (menu option `5`), for each request you'll be prompted to accept or reject:

```
1    (to accept)
```

or

```
2    (to reject)
```

One choice per pending request.

# How to Test InCollege - Week 5 Features

## Single Test File Approach

**Input file**: `InCollege-Input.txt`

This file contains a comprehensive test of ALL Week 5 connection management features.

---

## Quick Test

### Step 1: Setup Test Data
```bash
cd c:\Users\omark\Desktop\CEN4020-Project

# Clean previous test data
rm -f users.dat connections.dat profiles.dat InCollege-Output.txt

# Copy pre-configured test data
cp TEST-SETUP-users.dat users.dat
cp TEST-SETUP-connections.dat connections.dat
```

### Step 2: Compile & Run
```bash
# Compile (if needed)
cobc -x -free InCollege.cob -o InCollege

# Run test
./InCollege
```

### Step 3: Verify Results
```bash
# Check output
cat InCollege-Output.txt | grep -E "(accepted|rejected|Total connections)"

# Check connections
cat connections.dat
```

**Expected**: 2 accepted (bob, david), 2 rejected (charlie, emily)
