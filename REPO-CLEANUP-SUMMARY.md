## 🗑️ Files Removed

### Old Modular Story Files (10 files)
These were separate COBOL programs that have now been integrated into `InCollege.cob`:
- ✅ `Story79-Send-from-viewed-profile.cob`
- ✅ `Story80-Notify-when-sent.cob`
- ✅ `Story81-Validation-helpers.cob`
- ✅ `Story86-View-pending-requests.cob`

- ✅ `Story96_Main_Menu_Network.cob`
- ✅ `Story98_Connection_to_Outfile.cob`
- ✅ `Story-ITK87-ConnectionsOutput.cob`

**Reason**: All functionality now integrated into main `InCollege.cob`

### Old Epic 3 Files (2 files)
- ✅ `Epic3-Storyx-Test-Input.zip`
- ✅ `Epic3-Storyx-Test-Output.zip`

**Reason**: Superseded by Week 5 test infrastructure

### Commit Screenshot Files (4 files)
- ✅ `Commits-Andrew.png`
- ✅ `Commits-Omar.png`
- ✅ `Commits-Vivek.png`
- ✅ `Commits.png`

**Reason**: Not needed in repository

### Old Story 4 Documentation (6 files)

- ✅ `Story4-Test-Input.txt`
- ✅ `Story4-Test-Output.txt`
- ✅ `Story4-Testing-Guide.md`
- ✅ `STORY4-CONNECTION-REQUESTS-README.md`
- ✅ `STORY4-VERIFICATION-REPORT.md`

**Reason**: Superseded by Week 5 comprehensive testing documentation

## 📞 Need Something Back?

All deleted files are still in git history:
```bash
# To view deleted file
git show HEAD~1:Story93_Remove_Requests.cob

# To restore a deleted file
git checkout HEAD~1 -- Story93_Remove_Requests.cob
```

But they shouldn't be needed since all functionality is integrated!
