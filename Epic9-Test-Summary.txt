# Epic 9 Comprehensive Test Coverage Summary

The Epic9-Input.txt and Epic9-Output.txt files provide comprehensive test coverage for all three ITK stories:

## ITK-148: "As a user, I want to be informed if I have no messages to display."
✓ POSITIVE: User2 receives messages and sees them displayed
✓ NEGATIVE: User1 and User3 view messages when inbox is empty
✓ NEUTRAL: Multiple users with different message states

## ITK-149: "As a user, I want the 'Messages' menu to allow me to 'View My Messages'."
✓ POSITIVE: All users successfully access View My Messages option
✓ NEGATIVE: User2 enters invalid menu choice (5) and sees error message
✓ NEUTRAL: Users navigate back to main menu without issues

## ITK-150: "As a tester, I want the program to read all user inputs for viewing messages from a file so I can automate testing."
✓ POSITIVE: All inputs successfully read from file without manual intervention
✓ NEGATIVE: Program handles various error conditions gracefully
✓ NEUTRAL: Complex navigation sequences work correctly

## Additional Test Coverage:
1. Message to non-existent user - shows "User not found."
2. Self-messaging attempt - shows "You cannot send a message to yourself."
3. 200-character message truncation - message is cut off at exactly 200 chars
4. Multiple logins and message viewing sessions
5. Sender doesn't see sent messages in their inbox (only received messages)

## Test Flow:
1. Create 3 users (user1, user2, user3)
2. User1 logs in, views empty messages (ITK-148)
3. User1 sends valid message to user2
4. User1 attempts invalid messages (non-existent user, self)
5. User1 sends 200+ char message to user2 (truncated)
6. User1 views messages again (still empty - only shows received)
7. User2 logs in, tests invalid menu choice (ITK-149)
8. User2 views messages (sees 2 from user1)
9. User3 logs in, views empty messages (ITK-148)
10. User1 logs back in, sends message to user3
11. User1 views own messages (empty - hasn't received any)

This comprehensive test validates all requirements and edge cases.
