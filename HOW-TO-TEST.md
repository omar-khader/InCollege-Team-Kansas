# How to Test InCollege - Week 5 Features

## üéØ Single Test File Approach

**The ONLY input file you need**: `InCollege-Input.txt`

This file contains a comprehensive test of ALL Week 5 connection management features.

---

## üöÄ Quick Test (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Setup Test Data
```bash
cd c:\Users\omark\Desktop\CEN4020-Project

# Clean previous test data
rm -f users.dat connections.dat profiles.dat InCollege-Output.txt

# Copy pre-configured test data
cp TEST-SETUP-users.dat users.dat
cp TEST-SETUP-connections.dat connections.dat
```

### Step 2: Compile & Run
```bash
# Compile (if needed)
cobc -x -free InCollege.cob -o InCollege

# Run test
./InCollege
```

### Step 3: Verify Results
```bash
# Check output
cat InCollege-Output.txt | grep -E "(accepted|rejected|Total connections)"

# Check connections
cat connections.dat
```

**Expected**: 2 accepted (bob, david), 2 rejected (charlie, emily)

## üìÅ Required Files

### For Testing:
1. **InCollege.cob** - Main program
2. **InCollege-Input.txt** - THE test input file (this is the one!)
3. **TEST-SETUP-users.dat** - Pre-configured users (copy to users.dat)
4. **TEST-SETUP-connections.dat** - Pre-configured connections (copy to connections.dat)

### Generated During Test:
- `users.dat` - Runtime users (copied from TEST-SETUP)
- `connections.dat` - Runtime connections (copied from TEST-SETUP, then updated)
- `InCollege-Output.txt` - All program output
- `InCollege` - Compiled executable

## üéì Understanding the Input File

### InCollege-Input.txt Structure:
```
Line 1:    1              (Login choice)
Line 2:    alice          (Username)
Line 3:    AlicePass1!    (Password)
Line 4:    4              (View My Network)
Line 5:    2              (View Pending Requests)
Line 6:    1              (Accept bob)
Line 7:    2              (Reject charlie)
Line 8:    1              (Accept david)
Line 9:    2              (Reject emily)
Line 10:   2              (View Pending again)
Line 11:   3              (View My Connections)
Line 12:   4              (Go Back)
Line 13:   0              (Logout)
Line 14:   3              (Exit program)
```

Each line corresponds to ONE input the program expects.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Incorrect username/password"
**Solution**: Ensure you copied TEST-SETUP-users.dat to users.dat

### Issue: "No pending connection requests" immediately
**Solution**: Ensure you copied TEST-SETUP-connections.dat to connections.dat

### Issue: Wrong users in network
**Solution**: Check connections.dat - verify format is correct

### Issue: Program hangs
**Solution**: InCollege-Input.txt might be missing required inputs

---

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

Test is **PASSING** when you see:

1. ‚úÖ "Connection request from bob accepted!"
2. ‚úÖ "Connection request from charlie rejected!"
3. ‚úÖ "Connection request from david accepted!"
4. ‚úÖ "Connection request from emily rejected!"
5. ‚úÖ "No pending connection requests."
6. ‚úÖ "001. bob"
7. ‚úÖ "002. david"
8. ‚úÖ "Total connections: 002"

AND connections.dat contains 2 "connected" and 2 "rejected" entries.

## üöÄ For CI/CD Integration

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Automated test script

# Setup
rm -f users.dat connections.dat profiles.dat InCollege-Output.txt
cp TEST-SETUP-users.dat users.dat
cp TEST-SETUP-connections.dat connections.dat

# Compile
cobc -x -free InCollege.cob -o InCollege || exit 1

# Run test (InCollege-Input.txt is automatically used)
./InCollege

# Verify
if grep -q "Total connections: 002" InCollege-Output.txt && \
   grep -q "bob|alice|connected" connections.dat && \
   grep -q "david|alice|connected" connections.dat; then
    echo "‚úÖ TEST PASSED"
    exit 0
else
    echo "‚ùå TEST FAILED"
