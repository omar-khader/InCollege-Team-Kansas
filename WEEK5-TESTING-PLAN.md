# Week 5: Connection Management Testing Plan

## üìã Overview
This document outlines comprehensive test cases for Week 5 connection management functionalities including accepting requests, rejecting requests, viewing network, and persistence testing.

## üîç Code Review Summary

### Branch Analysis Completed:
- **Nicholas Keenan (nick-code)**: StoryEight.cob implements accept/reject functionality
- **Adesh Kessani (Adesh-Dev)**: Multiple story files for connection features (Stories 79, 80, 81, 86, 93, 94, 95, 96, 98)

### Key Findings:
1. **Nicholas's Implementation**: Standalone program with accept/reject in one flow
2. **Adesh's Implementation**: Modular approach with separate programs for different features
3. **Current Status**: Features need to be integrated into main InCollege.cob for comprehensive testing

## üß™ Test Case Categories

### 1. Accepting Connection Requests

#### Test Case 1.1: Accept Single Request
**Objective**: Verify that a user can successfully accept a single pending connection request

**Pre-conditions**:
- User `alice` exists and is logged in
- User `bob` has sent a connection request to `alice`
- Connection exists in `connections.dat`: `bob|alice|pending`

**Test Steps**:
1. Login as `alice`
2. Navigate to "View My Pending Connection Requests" (option 4)
3. System displays pending request from `bob`
4. Select option 1 (Accept) for `bob`'s request
5. Verify confirmation message: "Connection request from bob accepted!"

**Expected Results**:
- ‚úÖ Request status changes from "pending" to "connected" in `connections.dat`
- ‚úÖ Request no longer appears in pending requests list
- ‚úÖ Both users can see each other in their networks
- ‚úÖ Output file matches console output exactly

**Post-conditions**:
- `connections.dat` contains: `bob|alice|connected`

---

#### Test Case 1.2: Accept Multiple Requests Sequentially
**Objective**: Verify that a user can accept multiple connection requests one after another

**Pre-conditions**:

3. System displays all 3 pending requests
4. Accept `bob`'s request (option 1)
5. Accept `charlie`'s request (option 1)
6. Accept `david`'s request (option 1)
7. View pending requests again - should show none
8. View network - should show all 3 connections

**Expected Results**:
- ‚úÖ All requests show individual acceptance confirmations
- ‚úÖ All statuses change to "connected" in `connections.dat`
- ‚úÖ Pending requests list becomes empty
