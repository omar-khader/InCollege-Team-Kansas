# Quick Start: Week 5 Testing

## üöÄ Get Started in 5 Minutes

### Step 1: Review the Documentation
```bash
# Read the comprehensive test plan
cat WEEK5-TESTING-PLAN.md

# Read the execution guide
cat tests/week5/TEST-EXECUTION-GUIDE.md

# Review the summary
cat WEEK5-TESTING-SUMMARY.md
```

### Step 2: Choose Which Branch to Test

**Option A: Nicholas's Implementation (Standalone)**
```bash
git checkout -b testing-nick origin/nick-code
cobc -x -free StoryEight.cob -o InCollege
```

**Option B: Adesh's Implementation (Modular)**
```bash
git checkout -b testing-adesh origin/Adesh-Dev
# Compile individual story programs as needed
cobc -x -free Story93_Remove_Requests.cob -o Story93
cobc -x -free Story94_View_Connected_Users.cob -o Story94
```

### Step 3: Run Your First Test

**Test 1.1: Accept Single Request**
```bash
# Setup
cd /path/to/CEN4020-Project
rm -f InCollege-Output.txt connections.dat

# Prepare test data
echo "alice,AlicePass1!" > users.dat
echo "bob,BobPass1!" >> users.dat
cp tests/week5/accepting/test-1.1-setup-connections.dat connections.dat

# Execute test
cp tests/week5/accepting/test-1.1-accept-single-input.txt InCollege-Input.txt
./InCollege

# Verify
cat InCollege-Output.txt | grep "accepted"
cat connections.dat
```

### Step 4: Document Results
```bash
# Update the test matrix in WEEK5-TESTING-PLAN.md
# Mark test as PASS or FAIL
# If FAIL, create bug report using template
```
