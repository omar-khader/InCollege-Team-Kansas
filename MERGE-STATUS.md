   - Checks for reverse requests
   - Saves to `connections.dat` with status="pending"

2. **View Pending Connection Requests** ‚úÖ

   - Displays sender username
   - Shows count of pending requests
   - Filters by status="pending" and to_user=current_user

3. **View My Network** ‚úÖ
   - Menu option available
   - Sub-menu with:
     - 1. Send Connection Request
     - 2. View Pending Connection Requests
     - 3. Go Back

4. **Connection Data Persistence** ‚úÖ
   - All requests saved to `connections.dat`
   - Format: `from_user|to_user|status`
   - Persists across program restarts

5. **File I/O for Testing** ‚úÖ
   - Reads from `InCollege-Input.txt`
   - Writes to `InCollege-Output.txt`
   - All output captured for verification

### ‚ö†Ô∏è NOT YET Implemented in Main Program:
1. **Accept Connection Requests** ‚ùå
   - Available in separate program: `Story93_Remove_Requests.cob`
   - NOT integrated into main InCollege.cob yet

2. **Reject Connection Requests** ‚ùå
   - Available in separate program: `Story93_Remove_Requests.cob`
   - NOT integrated into main InCollege.cob yet

3. **Update Status** ‚ùå
   - No code to change status from "pending" to "connected" or "rejected"
   - Would need to be added to InCollege.cob

4. **View Connected Users (Network List)** ‚ùå

## üîß What Needs to Be Done

### To Complete Week 5 Testing:

#### Option A: Use Main InCollege.cob (Partial Testing)
**Can Test:**
- ‚úÖ Creating users
- ‚úÖ Creating profiles
- ‚úÖ Sending connection requests
- ‚úÖ Viewing pending requests
- ‚úÖ Basic menu navigation

**Cannot Test:**
- ‚ùå Accepting requests
- ‚ùå Rejecting requests
- ‚ùå Viewing connected users list
- ‚ùå Status updates

#### Option B: Integrate Accept/Reject from Nicholas's Branch
**Steps:**
1. Get accept/reject logic from `origin/nick-code:StoryEight.cob`
2. Add to InCollege.cob in `view-pending-requests` procedure
3. Implement interactive prompt: "1. Accept, 2. Reject"
4. Add status update logic (pending ‚Üí connected/rejected)
5. Test with Week5-Complete-Test-Input.txt

#### Option C: Use Separate Story Programs
**Steps:**
1. Run InCollege.cob first (send requests)
2. Run Story93_Remove_Requests.cob (accept/reject)
3. Run Story94_View_Connected_Users.cob (view network)
4. Verify connections.dat after each step

---

## üìä Current State of connections.dat

After using current InCollege.cob, you'll get:
```
from_user|to_user|pending
```

After integration, you should get:
```
from_user|to_user|connected    (if accepted)
from_user|to_user|rejected     (if rejected, or removed)
```

---

## üöÄ Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate Testing (Partial):
```bash
# Test what's working now
cp Week5-Complete-Test-Input.txt InCollege-Input.txt
cobc -x -free InCollege.cob -o InCollege
./InCollege

# Verify:
cat connections.dat
# Should show 4 pending requests (bob, charlie, david, emily ‚Üí alice)
```

### For Full Testing:
We need to add accept/reject functionality to InCollege.cob. I can:
1. Add the accept/reject logic from Nicholas's StoryEight.cob
2. Integrate it into the `view-pending-requests` procedure
3. Add status update functionality
4. Then run full comprehensive test

---

## üéØ What You Can Test Right Now

With current merged code:
- ‚úÖ User creation (all 5 users)
- ‚úÖ Profile creation (all 5 profiles)
- ‚úÖ Login/logout flows
- ‚úÖ Navigation to "View My Network"
- ‚úÖ Sending connection requests (4 requests)
- ‚úÖ Viewing pending requests (alice sees 4 pending)
- ‚úÖ File I/O (input from file, output to file)
- ‚úÖ Data persistence (connections.dat)

What requires additional code:
- ‚ùå Interactive accept (1) / reject (2) prompts
- ‚ùå Status updates (pending ‚Üí connected/rejected)
- ‚ùå Displaying connected users in network
- ‚ùå Removing/hiding processed requests

---

## üí° Options for You

### Option 1: Test Partial Functionality Now
Use the merged code to test sending and viewing requests. This validates:
- User/profile creation
- Request sending
- Request viewing
- Basic persistence

### Option 2: Let Me Add Accept/Reject
I can integrate the accept/reject functionality from Nicholas's code into InCollege.cob, then you can run the full comprehensive test.

### Option 3: Manual Testing with Story Programs
Use the modular Story programs separately:
1. Send requests with InCollege.cob
2. Accept/reject with Story93_Remove_Requests.cob
3. View network with Story94_View_Connected_Users.cob

**Which option would you prefer?**
