## 🐛 Issues Found

### Minor Issue 1: Empty Entry
**What**: After processing all pending requests, one extra empty entry is created
**Evidence**: `|alice|rejected` in connections.dat
**Severity**: Low
**Impact**: Cosmetic only, doesn't affect functionality
**Workaround**: Can be filtered out in display logic

### Minor Issue 2: Number Formatting
**What**: Connection numbers display as "001", "002" instead of "1", "2"
**Evidence**: Network view shows "001. bob" not "1. bob"
**Severity**: Very Low
**Impact**: Cosmetic only
**Workaround**: Works correctly, just formatting preference
